mhood112: A gym has been partenring with their local elementary school to demonstrate the effects of diet and exercise on heart rate. The data collected by the gym is contained in the Exercise_Data.csv. Create a heatmap of the pulse data. Create a categorical plot fo pulse values by diet and by type of exercise. Provide a brief explanation of what conclusions can be drawn from the data that could be give to the elementary school students. Make sure that your visualizations have appropriate titles, acis labels, and legends.

Workspace: Here's an outline for a Jupyter notebook to analyze the gym's data and create visualizations:

* **Import Required Libraries**
* **Load and Explore the Dataset**
* **Create a Heatmap of Pulse Data**
* **Create a Categorical Plot of Pulse by Diet and Exercise Type**
* **Provide Conclusions for Elementary School Students**

mhood112: Using the planets built-in dataset, create 2 graphs of each of the three plot types (relational, distributional, and categorical). These graphs should have appropriate titles, axis labels, and legends. Provide a brief explanation about which graph(s) you feel best demonstrate something notable about the data, and how it is illustrated.

GitHub Copilot: Hereâ€™s how you can use the `planets` dataset from the `seaborn` library to create the required graphs. Below is the Python code to include in your open file:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the planets dataset
planets = sns.load_dataset('planets')

# Relational Plots
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Scatter plot: Orbital period vs. Planet mass
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.scatterplot(data=planets, x='orbital_period', y='mass', hue='method')
plt.title('Orbital Period vs. Planet Mass')
plt.xlabel('Orbital Period (days)')
plt.ylabel('Mass (Jupiter Mass)')
plt.legend(title='Detection Method', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')

# Line plot: Year vs. Number of planets discovered
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.lineplot(data=planets, x='year', y=planets.groupby('year')['name'].count())
plt.title('Planets Discovered Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Planets Discovered')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Distributional Plots
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Histogram: Distribution of planet masses
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.histplot(planets['mass'].dropna(), bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Planet Masses')
plt.xlabel('Mass (Jupiter Mass)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')

# Boxplot: Orbital period distribution
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.boxplot(x=planets['orbital_period'].dropna())
plt.title('Orbital Period Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Orbital Period (days)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Categorical Plots
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Count plot: Number of planets discovered by method
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.countplot(data=planets, y='method', order=planets['method'].value_counts().index)
plt.title('Number of Planets Discovered by Method')
plt.xlabel('Count')
plt.ylabel('Detection Method')

# Bar plot: Average planet mass by detection method
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.barplot(data=planets, x='method', y='mass', estimator=lambda x: x.mean(skipna=True))
plt.title('Average Planet Mass by Detection Method')
plt.xlabel('Detection Method')
plt.ylabel('Average Mass (Jupiter Mass)')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
